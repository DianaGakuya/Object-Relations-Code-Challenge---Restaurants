# Object Relations Code Challenge - Restaurants

This repository contains a Python implementation for the Object Relations Code Challenge related to a Yelp-style domain. The challenge involves designing and implementing classes for `Customer`, `Restaurant`, and `Review` with specific functionalities and relationships.

## Overview

This code challenge focuses on building a system that models relationships between customers, restaurants, and reviews. The implementation includes features such as creating customers and restaurants, adding reviews, and calculating average ratings.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main Python files:

- **`customer.py`**: Contains the implementation of the `Customer` class.
- **`restaurant.py`**: Contains the implementation of the `Restaurant` class.
- **`review.py`**: Contains the implementation of the `Review` class.
- **`test.py`**: A script with test cases to ensure the correctness of the implemented classes.

Class Implementation
Customer
The Customer class represents a customer and includes methods for retrieving and managing customer information, such as names and reviews.

## Restaurant
The Restaurant class represents a restaurant and provides methods to retrieve information about the restaurant, its reviews, and calculate the average star rating.

## Review
The Review class represents a review given by a customer for a particular restaurant. It includes methods to retrieve information about the review, the associated customer, and the restaurant.

## Test Cases
The test.py script includes a comprehensive set of test cases to verify the correct implementation of the classes. These tests cover various scenarios, including creating instances, adding reviews, and retrieving information.
